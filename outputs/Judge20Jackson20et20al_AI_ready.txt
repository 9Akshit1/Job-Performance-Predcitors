We used both regression and path analysis, relying on programs developed by Hunter (1992) and Teachout (1995) We used the median sample size for the jobperformance correlations as the sample size. We estimated two models. In the first regression, work-relatedperformance was regressed on the distal variables alone. In a second regression, performance was regressed on all the variables, along with self-efficacy. Taken together, the two models form a hierarchical regression analysis.

   CONTEXT: gested because of the relationship
between self-set goals and self-efficacy, in some models they are com-

was strong (ÀÜ  .50; k  50, N  8,126); however, when we added self-set
goals to the overall analysis, it had a small effect on the self-efficacy‚Äìper-

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
Literature Search
In forming the correlation matrix that was used as input into the
multivariate analyses, we took two steps. First, where meta-
analytic estimates were already available, we used these directly.
In cases in which multiple meta-analyses were conducted, we used
the most recent comprehensive meta-analysis available.2 Second,
where meta-analytic estimates were unavailable, we performed our
own meta-analyses. In order to identify the population of articles
needed to calculate the remaining estimates in the correlation
matrix, we searched the PsycINFO database for studies published
between 1887 and 2002 that referenced these remaining relation-
ships. In two instances, multiple keywords were used. For GMA,
we used the keywords intelligence, IQ, mental ability, and cogni-
tive ability, whereas for emotional stability, we searched for arti-
cles that also included the keyword neuroticism. The results of the
initial search and of the number of studies that were deemed

DISCUSSION SECTION EXCERPT:
Social‚Äìcognitive theory and its central variable, self-efficacy,
have been the focus of a voluminous amount of research in
psychology. Its applicability has been described as ‚Äúpervasive
across contexts and domains of human functioning‚Äù (Zimmerman
& Schunk, 2003, p. 448). A primary application of self-efficacy
has been in the work domain (Bandura, 1997); it appears that the
dominant role of self-efficacy in work motivation research antic-
ipated by Landy (1989) has been realized. However, any con
