📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
The original results of Hunter and Hunter (1984) for all 11 of the predictors they compared are presented in Table 1. For the four levels of structure, the sample-size-weighted corre-lations were .ll, .20, .34, and .17 for Level 1 to Level 4 structures. The current Mela-Analysis predicts rho ranging from .20 to .57. Data are from "Validity and Utility of Alternative Predictors of jobperformance," by J. E. Hunter & R. F. Hunter, 1984, Psychological Bul-letin. Dashes indicate that these data were not provided by Hunter & Hunter. The results demonstrate that mean validity generally appears to increase with increasing levels of structure. However, this trend asymptotes at Structure 3, beyond which additional structure yields very little incremental validity (Ar = .01) The results suggest that rhomates of rho along with their population standard deviations, are reported in the lower half of Table 1. The results are from "Validity and Utility of Alternative Predictors of jobperformance," by J. E. Hunter & R. F. Hunter, 1984.

There were several limitations of the present study, and these
should be noted. First, the two-dimensional framework pre-
sented in this investigation may not fully represent all of the
dimensions of interview standardization. Second, the structure

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
Interview Data Set
The data set analyzed consisted of 114 interview validity coefficients,
all of which involved entry-level jobs and supervisory rating criteria and
could be classified as to their level of structure with respect to standard-
ization of interview questions and response scoring. These studies en-
compassed both published and unpublished research; our sources were
journal articles (n = 45), dissertations (n = 30), technical reports (n =
26), master's theses (n = 8), unpublished or submitted manuscripts (n
= 2), books (n = 2), and conference papers (n = 1). Although a majority
of the studies were North American, five were conducted in other coun-
tries (Ghana, England, The Netherlands, Israel, and Australia). A com-
plete listing of the sources for these studies is available from Allen I.
Huffcutt.
Although there was some overlap between our studies and those ana-
lyzed in other interview meta-analyses, this overlap tended to be rela-
tively low. In total, there were 84 r

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
The original results of Hunter and Hunter (1984) for all 11 of
the predictors they compared are presented in Table 1. The
mean sample-size-weighted correlation across all 114 validity
coefficients in the current investigation was .22 (SD = . 14). For
the four levels of structure, the sample-size-weighted corre-
lations were .ll(SD = .04), .20 (SD = . 11), .34 (SD = . 12), and
.34 (SD = .17) for Level 1 to Level 4 structures, respectively.
Correcting for criterion unreliability and range restriction re-
sulted in estimates of rho ranging from .20 to .57. These esti-

DISCUSSION SECTION EXCERPT:
Results of this investigation suggest that the overall validity
of the interview for entry-level jobs is much higher than was
indicated by Hunter and Hunter (1984) in their analysis. In ad-
dition, our relatively sophisticated system of structure classifi-
cation resulted in several insights into the relationship between
level of structure and the validity of the interview. Specifically,
these results (a) confirm that structure is a major moderator of
interview validity, (b) demonstrate that val
