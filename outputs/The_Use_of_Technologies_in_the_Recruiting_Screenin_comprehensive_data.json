These\ninterviews allowed us to discover the types of technologies\nused in leading companies and to identify critical issues\nrelated to technologies.\nIn February 2001, we designed the web-based survey to\nassess HR professionals’ use of technologies with job\ncandidates. To minimize the influence of priming effects,\ntwo versions of the survey were created by counter-\nbalancing the order of data collected. The survey collected\na wide variety of data from HR professionals representing\n125 organizations. These professionals were sampled from\nmembers of the Society for Human Resource Management\n(SHRM) who had indicated that they were at the corporate\nlevel (as opposed to branch or r",
