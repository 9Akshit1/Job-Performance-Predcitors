  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "This meta-analysis builds upon a previous meta- analysis by Joseph and Newman (2010) by including 65% more studies. We classified EI studies into 3 streams: (1) ability based models that use objective test items; (2) self-report or peer report measures based on the four branch model of EI; and (3) “mixed models’ of emotional competencies. The three streams had corrected correlations ranging from .24 to .3. We classified EI studies into 3 streams: ability based models that use objective test items, self-report or peer report measures based on the four branch model of EI, and mixed models of emotional competencies. The three streams correlated differently with cognitive ability and with neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Emotional intelligence (EI) has received a substantial amount of attention in recent years. All three streams of EI exhibited substantial relative importance in the presence of the FFM and intelligence when predicting job performance. The results support the all validity of emotional intelligence.",
