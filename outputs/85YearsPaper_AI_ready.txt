📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
The Validity and Utility of Selection Methods in Personnel Psychology. Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings. Article was published in Psychological Bulletin · September 1998. See discussions, stats, and author profiles for this publication at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283803351. This page was uploaded by Frank L. Schmidt on 11 April 2016. The user has requested enhancement of the downloaded file. This article summarizes the practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research in personnelselection. On the basis of meta-analytic findings, this article presents the validity of 19 selection procedures. This article presents the validity of 19 selection procedures for predicting job performance and training performance. The practical utility implications of these summary findings are substantial. The implica-tions of these research findings for the development of theories of job performance are discussed.

The major personality trait that has been studied in causal
models of job performance is conscientiousness.This research
has found that. controlling for mental ability, employees who
are higher in conscientiousness develop higher levels of job
