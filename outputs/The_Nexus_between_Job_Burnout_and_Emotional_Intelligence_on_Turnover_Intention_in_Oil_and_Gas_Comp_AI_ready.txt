üìã PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
The results of the ongoing study firstly shows the convergent validity that describes the links among the items. The statistics of loading and AVE are larger than 0.50 while statistics of  ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†ÔøΩCR and Alpha are not lower than. 0.70 which shows that there is a high linkage. The output of the current study secondly show the discriminant validity that. describes the link between the items and emotions. The output of the current study secondly show the discriminant validity that describes the  ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Nexus among the constructs. The figures of Heterotrait Monotrait ratios are not bigger than 0.90 that show the no high linkage among constructs. The findings of the path analysis show that job burnout, job satisfaction, and emotional intelligence have a positive association with turnover intentions and accept H1, H2, and H3. The figures of Heterotrait Monotrait ratios are not bigger than  ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†0.90 that show the no high linkage among the constructs.

1. PREDICTOR: intelligence
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: advantages. There is a deep significance 
in understanding the relationship and the impact of the IVs and the DVs and the mediating 
factors of this study. This study shall use a quantitative method of research employing only 
survey sessions with employees of oil and gas companies in UAE. This will be another 
theoretical contribution to this subject and will add a new avenue of understanding.

   CONTEXT: re of employees to adjust and cope up 
with the work pressure, which is very high in UAE‚Äôs oil and gas industry (Vanda & 
Haghighi, 2014). Threats to the job and other severe risks are also present in these oil 
companies. Due to this, job burnout is seen among employees of the UAE‚Äôs oil and gas 
companies.  
 
The reason to include emotional intelligence in this study is justified because it is t

   CONTEXT: lay any mediating role 
between job burnout and turnover intention. Leunissen et al., (2018) believe that job 
satisfaction at work helps people to develop their self-motivation, which plays an active role 
in resolving burnout issues and checking the rate of employee turnover. Hence, this study 
shall examine the mediating role of job satisfaction with variables like job burnout, emotional
