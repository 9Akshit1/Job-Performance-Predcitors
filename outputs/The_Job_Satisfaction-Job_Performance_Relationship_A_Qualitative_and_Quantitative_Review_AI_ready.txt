üìã PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
The seven general models of the job satisfaction-job performance relationship are inconsistent. Part of the confusion may be due to the piecemeal nature of the research. If there is little relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, little to be gained by testing the validity of Models 1-4. If there is little relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, then there can be no direct causal effect. Models 5-7 could be valid in the context of a zero or very weak correlation between individual satisfaction and performance. An important first step in determining the merits of models of the satisfaction-performance relationship is to determine the magnitude of the relationship. There have been two meta-analyses of the job satisfaction-job performance relationship. Petty et al. (1984) provided a limited meta-analysis of the relationship. The authors confined their analyses to 16 studies that werepublished in five journals from 1964 to 1983.

üéØ JOB PERFORMANCE PREDICTORS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------------------------
1. PREDICTOR: IQ
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 0.8
   CONTEXT: ature is somewhat archaic; causal satisfaction-per-
formance studies appeared only in the 1970s. If the relationship is
an important one, as our results suggest, studies of causal influence
should resume. Even if job satisfaction and job performance mu-
tually influence each other, it appears quite possible that the
relationship between satisfaction and performance is indirect, me-
diated by other

2. PREDICTOR: personality
   CATEGORY: personality
   CONFIDENCE: 0.8
   CONTEXT: er research on the validity of
self-esteem as a moderator. Dipboye (1977) proposed many re-
finements to Korman's (1970) theory that might advance research
in this area, yet few of the propositions and suggestions in Dip-
boye's review have been investigated.

   CONTEXT: nward biases in esti-
mates of actual validity, (p. 209)
Furthermore, generalizability theory (Cronbach, Gleser, Nanda, &
Rajaratnam, 1972) would suggest that corrections based on inter-
rater reliability are more likely to reflect the context to which one
seeks to generalize the relationship. Specifically, if one is gener-
alizing to one supervisor's performance rating at one point in time,
then 

6. PREDICTOR: job performance
   CATEGORY: job_performance
   CONFIDENCE: 0.94
   CONTEXT: iability. Unlike laffaldano and Muchinsky, how-
ever, where a study reported correlations involving multiple job
satisfaction facets, we combined these facets into a composite
measure of overall job satisfaction. The uncorrected (.20) and
corrected (.25) correlations are significantly higher than those
originally reported by laffaldano and Muchinsky. This is due to the
fact that row 2 represents a

   CATEGORY: assessment_center
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: to be nonzero, the credibility interval is
relatively wide (from .03 to .57), indicating that there is substantial
variation in the individual correlations across the 312 studies.
Furthermore, the Q statistic was significant, and sampling error
and measurement error accounted for only 25% of this variability.
This evidence suggests that there are moderators of the relation-
ship at the study level

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
Overall Analysis
Results of the overall meta-analysis of the relationship between
job satisfaction and job performance are provided in Table 1. The
sample size weighted mean correlation between overall job satis-
faction and job performance, uncorrected for study artifacts or
unreliability, was .18. The estimated population value of the cor-
relation between overall job satisfaction and general job perfor-
mance was .30 when the correlations were corrected for unreli-
ability in satisfaction and performance measures. For this estimate,
the 95% confidence interval excluded zero, indicating that we can
be confident that the average true correlation is nonzero and
relatively invariable (.27 to .33). The 80% credibility interval also
excluded zero, indicating that more than 90% of the individual
corrected true score correlations are greater than zero (the other
10% of the correlations lie above the upper end of the interval,
.57). Thus, these results indicate that the mean true correlation
