üî¨ STUDY CHARACTERISTICS
--------------------------------------------------
STUDY TYPE: cross_sectional
JOB DOMAIN: healthcare
MEASUREMENT TYPE: self_report
SAMPLE SIZE (N): 5000
employees
SAMPLE CONTEXT: These professionals were sampled from
members of the Society for Human Resource Management
(SHRM) who had indicated that they were at the corporate
level (as opposed to branch or regional level) and listed

The typical respondent described their position in Human Resources as: manager (43.3%), other (22.7%), director (12.4%), president (5.1%), vice president (4.1%) and assistant manager (2.1%). The respondents were a fairly well educated group with 63.3% possessing a bachelor‚Äôs degree, 11.7% aBA, 10.6% some college work, and 1.1% a doctorate. Most frequent age group was 30‚Äì39 (36.6%) followed by 40‚Äì49 (21.5%) and 50‚Äì59 (15.1%) In addition, the majority of participants was 71.6% female (71.6%).Technologies used by Function and Organizational Level (Functional) and Level of Experience (Level of Experience) HR managers used various media to advertise their positions.

üéØ JOB PERFORMANCE PREDICTORS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------------------------
1. PREDICTOR: cognitive ability
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 0.7
   CONTEXT: he first argument is that the use of
technology appears to be very successful in generating
applicants (although not always the right ones) suggesting
that applicants are comfortable enough to use the
technology when it is provided. The second argument is
that, while a larger number of applicants may result,
ultimately, a more efficient screening system may permit
more ‚Äôface time‚Äô with the best ap

2. PREDICTOR: personality
   CATEGORY: personality
   CONFIDENCE: 0.7
   CONTEXT: ned out.
What about Cheating? Organizations identified a hurdle
to using online applications, particularly for using compu-
ter-based testing for cognitive ability, knowledge, etc. ‚Äì that
is, the problem of ensuring that the individual sitting at the
computer is really the applicant and not a local rocket
scientist hired to take the test for the applicant. Further,
employers worried about placing 

3. PREDICTOR: education
   CATEGORY: education
   CONFIDENCE: 0.7
   CONTEXT: he organization, choosing from six categories that
matched the SHRM membership database (i.e., less than
100; 100‚Äì499; 500‚Äì999, 1000‚Äì2499, 2500‚Äì4999, 5000
and above). Another item asked respondents to estimate
the number of employees in five years‚Äô time to get an
estimate of the organization‚Äôs growth rate. The job title of
the person completing the survey was captured by choosing
from 12 categorie

4. PREDICTOR: abilities
   CATEGORY: skills
   CONFIDENCE: 0.7
   CONTEXT: hurdle

ter-based testing for cognitive ability, knowledge, etc. ‚Äì that
is, the problem of ensuring that the individual sitting at the
computer is really the applicant and not a local rocket

5. PREDICTOR: EQ
   CATEGORY: emotional_intelligence
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: her organizational image predicted future
investment in HR technology we first subjected the 16
organizational image items to a principal components
factor analysis with orthogonal rotation. This yielded two
organizational image factors including: (a) People Orienta-
tion, 11 items, alpha 5 .97, (e.g., ‚Äòrespect for people‚Äô,
‚Äòpeople orientation‚Äô, ‚Äòwell-managed‚Äô, ‚Äòan excellent employ-
er‚Äô) and (b) D

   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: gh adopting these technologies.
For example, it is important to know whether HR
managers are realizing the benefits they envisioned when
they purchased these technologies.
Although technology is rapidly changing the Human
Resource function in many organizations, we know little
about whether adopting these technologies has provided
solutions to HR problems. Although anecdotes are readily
available,

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
This study consisted of a web-based survey administered to
a broad subset of HR managers who were members of the
Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM).
Before conducting the survey, we conducted in-depth
interviews with six senior HR personnel from some of the
world‚Äôs largest and most influential companies. These
interviews allowed us to discover the types of technologies
used in leading companies and to identify critical issues
related to technologies.
In February 2001, we designed the web-based survey to
assess HR professionals‚Äô use of technologies with job
candidates. To minimize the influence of priming effects,
two versions of the survey were created by counter-
balancing the order of data collected. The survey collected
a wide variety of data from HR professionals representing
125 organizations. These professionals were sampled from
members of the Society for Human Resource Management
(SHRM) who had indicated that they were at the corporate
level (as opposed to branch or r

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
Approximately 75% of the respondents completed the
demographic characteristics. They represented a wide
variety of organizations in many industries, including ‚Äòfor
profit services‚Äô industry (20.4%), other (18.3%), manu-
facturing durables (12.9%), and utilities (9.7%), with the
remaining organizations spread over the other industries
listed in the survey. The respondents worked in organiza-
tions that ranged in size from less than 100 to over 5000:
the largest group came from organizations exceeding 5000
employees (23.7%), followed by 100‚Äì499 employees
(21.6%), 500‚Äì999 (15.5%), o100 (15.5%), 1000‚Äì2499
(13.4%), and 2500‚Äì4999 (10.3%). The typical respondent
described their position in Human Resources as: manager
(43.3%), other (22.7%), director (12.4%), president
(5.1%), vice president (4.1%), consultant (4.1%), super-
visor (3.1%), administrator (3.1%), and assistant manager
(2.1%). The respondents were a fairly well educated group
with 63.3% possessing a bachelor‚Äôs degree, 11.7% an
MBA
