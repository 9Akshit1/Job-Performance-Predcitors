  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "The NEO-Personality Inventory – Revised and Performance Appraisal Questionnaire were used as measuring instruments. The results showed that Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness were related to task performance and creativity. Three personality dimensions explained 28% of the variance inparticipants’ management performance. The NEO-Personality Inventory – Revised is as meet-                instrumente gebruik. Emotional Stability, Openness to Experience and Agreeableness explained 28% of the variance in                participants’ management performance.

The total population of pharmacists (n =\n59) and non-pharmacists (n = 100) was included in the\nempirical study. All pharmacists had a B.Pharm. degree or a\nDiploma in Pharmacy, while the qualifications of non-\npharmacists varied from Grade 10 to a master’s degree. About\n57% of the sample had some form of post-school education.\nThe total population of employees participated in the research.\nApproximately 83% of the sample consisted of females.

Regarding skewness and\nkurtosis, it is clear that the results were somewhat skew\nregarding Task Performance. This skewness may be attributed\nto the fact that poor performers on this dimension probably\nleft the organisation. Scores on the other dimensions seem to\nbe normally distributed. Table 1 shows that high Cronbach\nalpha coefficients were obtained for all the factors (Nunnally\n& Bernstein, 1994). The correlation coefficients between the\nitems of scales (0,48 \u0002 r \u0002 0,70) indicate that the items\ncorrelate too highly (Clark & Watson, 1995).
