  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations and                 intercorrelations among the personality and cognitive ability measures collected at end of year 2007 for 129 sales people. Correlations corrected                 for range restriction and criteria unreliability are also reported in Table 4. Table 3 presents the assessment validity of the test battery in predicting objective sales metrics. Correlations corrected                 for range restriction and criteria unreliability are also reported in Table 4. An estimate of .85 was used for criteria                 unreliability as this represents a very conservative estimate                 of measurement errors. All predictors were significantly and positively correlated to sales attainment in 2008. The strongest relationship was found for achievement orientation. For the profit margin metric, only cognitive ability was significantly related to sales performance. As shown in Table 7 and 8,                             cognitive ability was significantly and po",
