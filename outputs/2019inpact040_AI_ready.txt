📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
The study aimed to examine the relationship between personality traits according to the Six Factor Personality Inventory (HEXACO), and job performance and job satisfaction. A total of 852 people                  (433 women and 419 men) from 154 different professions participated in the study. To predict job performance and job satisfaction, the data was analyzed by multiple linear regression. The sub-dimensions of Modesty, Fairness, Social                  Self-Esteem, Liveliness, Perfectionism, Diligence and the factors of Extraversion, Conscientiousness                 predicted job performance. Job performance groups differed in the factors of Honesty-Humility, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and job satisfaction groups. As for the sub-dimensions, groups that were high in job performance andJob satisfaction differed from the groups that were low in many personality traits.
