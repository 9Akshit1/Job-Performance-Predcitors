  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "Data mining methods have been used to study a variety of topics in industrial and organizational psychology, including predicting employee performance. Out of 103 studies reviewed, eight studies were retained and used for the meta-analyses. The results suggested that both data mining methods showed good performance in employee performance prediction, although the difference between the overall effect sizes was not statistically significant. The number of employee performance classifications meta-analyzed was 2430. The results suggested that both data mining methods showed good performance in employee performance prediction. The difference between the overall effect sizes was not statistically significant. The theoretical and practical implications were discussed, and recommendations were provided for future research. I would first like to thank my advisor, Dr. Shiyang Su, for her continuous support. I am grateful to Dr. Victoria Pace and Dr. Steve Jex for serving as my  committee members. I would like to extend my thanks to Dani Draper, as you always provide unwavering help throughout my time at the program.",

More specifically, the results suggested there were no \nstatistically significant differences between the overall DORs of DTs and ANNs. \nThe heterogeneity statistics for the two data mining methods were in the two extremes, \nnecessitating further explanations.

One potential explanation of such a high \nheterogeneity might be lying under the fact that different studies used different algorithms of \nDT. More specifically, the DT algorithms that were used included CART (Agaoglu, 2016; \nMellisa, 2019), C4.5 (Kirimi & Moturi, 2016; Nedelcu et al., 2020; Rajesh, 2017; Wagh, \n2010), and C5.0",
