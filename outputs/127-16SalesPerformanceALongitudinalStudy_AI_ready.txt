📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations and                 intercorrelations among the personality and cognitive ability measures collected at end of year 2007 for 129 sales people. Correlations corrected                 for range restriction and criteria unreliability are also reported in Table 4. Table 3 presents the assessment validity of the test battery in predicting objective sales metrics. Correlations corrected                 for range restriction and criteria unreliability are also reported in Table 4. An estimate of .85 was used for criteria                 unreliability as this represents a very conservative estimate                 of measurement errors. All predictors were significantly and positively correlated to sales attainment in 2008. The strongest relationship was found for achievement orientation. For the profit margin metric, only cognitive ability was significantly related to sales performance. As shown in Table 7 and 8,                             cognitive ability was significantly and po

sales performance and provides much needed research 
examining the extent to which these variables are 
capable of predicting performance over time. To our 
knowledge, this is the first study to look at both cognitive

formula developed by Raju and Brand (2003) for correlations

   CONTEXT: . Although the 
relationship with cognitive ability dissipated in 
subsequent years, supporting Murphy’s model, the 
relationship with personality did not provide a clear 
pattern of results by which we can make strong 
conclusions. Thus, our longitudinal results are not directly 
in line with Thoresen et.al (2004) with regard to 
personality. They found that extraversion and 
conscientiousness we

These results provide support for Hypothesis 1a

Limitations & Future Directions 
One of the major limitations of this study was data attrition; 
only forty percent of sample was retained after four years.  
Although this is probably expected for data collected in 
applied settings, it prohibits us from drawing strong 
conclusions or using more robust statistical tests to examine 
the hypotheses.  It is possible

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
Participants and Procedures 
Incumbent Sample.  A sample of 124 incumbent sales 
people (52% male) from a national office product retailer 
was used in this present study.  The target position is a 
business to business consultative sales role.  All 
individuals completed a sales assessment test battery in 
December of 2007 as part of a concurrent validation 
research study examining the assessment validity. The 
ethnic distribution was 82% White/Caucasian, 7% 
Black/African American, 6% Hispanic, 4% Asian. The 
organizational tenure ranged from 14 months to 29 years 
(M=8.29 years, SD=6.18 years).   
 Archival annual sales performance metrics were 
subsequently obtained for four years following the initial 
testing (years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011). As expected, 
data attrition occurred as some individuals were no longer 
employed by the organization, moved to a significantly 
different type of job within the organization, or other 
reasons.  Subsequently, the sample size decreased o

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
We first analyzed the incumbent data. The results from 
this sample represent test validity in the maintenance 
phase.  Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations and 
intercorrelations among the personality and cognitive ability 
measures collected at end of year 2007 for 129 sales people.  
Table 2 presents the means, standard deviations, and 
intercorrelations among objective performance metrics 
from year 2008 to year 2011.  As mentioned earlier, data 
attrition resulted in smaller sample sizes for subsequent 
years with sample size ranged from 80 to 52.   
Table 3 presents the assessment validity of the test battery 
in predicting objective sales metrics.  Correlations corrected 
for range restriction and criteria unreliability are also 
reported in Table 4.  An estimate of .85 was used for criteria 
unreliability as this represents a very conservative estimate 
of measurement errors by Hunter and Schmidt (1990) and 
has been utilized in previous meta-analytic studies with

knowledge, this is the first study to look at both cognitive
