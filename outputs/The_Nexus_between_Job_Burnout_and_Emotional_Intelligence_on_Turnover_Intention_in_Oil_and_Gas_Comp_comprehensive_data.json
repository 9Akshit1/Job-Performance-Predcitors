The statistics of loading and AVE are larger than 0.50 while statistics of                 �CR and Alpha are not lower than. 0.70 which shows that there is a high linkage. The output of the current study secondly show the discriminant validity that. describes the link between the items and emotions. The output of the current study secondly show the discriminant validity that describes the                  Nexus among the constructs. The figures of Heterotrait Monotrait ratios are not bigger than 0.90 that show the no high linkage among constructs. The findings of the path analysis show that job burnout, job satisfaction, and emotional intelligence have a positive association with turnover intentions and accept H1, H2, and H3. The figures of Heterotrait Monotrait ratios are not bigger than                 0.90 that show the no high linkage among the constructs.",
