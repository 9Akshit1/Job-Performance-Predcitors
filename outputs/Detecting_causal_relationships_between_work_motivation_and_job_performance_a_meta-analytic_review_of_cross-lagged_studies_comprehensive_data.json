Overall, work motivation appears to be a Predictor of job performance, whereas job performance appearsto be a predictor of work motivation. Table 2 depicts the averaged correlation (r) and true score (ρ) of interest. Overall, work motivation appears to be a predictor of job performance. However, the path coefﬁcient (i.e., P1 →M2) from performance (T1) to motivation (T2) is positive. The overall publication bias is not serious. The path coefﬁcient (i.e., P1 →M2) from performance (T1) to. grotesque (P2) is positive. However, the correlation between P1 and P2 is not as strong as previously thought.",
