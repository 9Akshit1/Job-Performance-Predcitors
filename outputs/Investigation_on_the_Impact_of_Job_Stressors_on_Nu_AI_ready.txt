üìã PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
300 questionnaires were distributed to qualified nurses in 7 private hospitals across Malaysia. Outcomes from a series of hypothesis tests support the researchers‚Äô study that each independent variable has significant relationship to job performance of nurses. Authors hope to identify the relationship between the job stressors towards job performance. Stress is a perceived concept that is caused by anything that  unbalances the harmony in one‚Äôs life. The relationship can result in either a beneficial or a negative effect on a person. The researchers found that each independent variable has significant relationship to job performance of nurses. Stress is a perceived concept that is caused by anything that unbalances the harmony in one‚Äôs life. Different types of stress produce anxiety in individuals, which results in feelings of apprehension that can ultimately lead to negative physical, emotional, cognitive andbehavioral symptoms.

üéØ JOB PERFORMANCE PREDICTORS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------------------------
1. PREDICTOR: ability test
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: dent variables and job performance as dependent variable. Job performance 
is the level of productivity of an individual employee, relative to his or her peers, on several job-related 
behaviors and outcomes. There are three individual job performance summated to create a measurement of 
overall job performance in this study which are quality, absenteeism, and new learning. 
Pilot test was needed 

2. PREDICTOR: education
   CATEGORY: education
   CONFIDENCE: 0.91
   CONTEXT: nd organizational 
performance. This is particularly crucial especially for new nurses who just entered the profession in the health 
care industry. Managing this stressor can avoid high turnover of nurses in workplaces. Findings from this study 
will enable organization‚Äôs top level management to understand the relationship between job stressors and job 
performance of nurses and therefore evolve 

3. PREDICTOR: EQ
   CATEGORY: emotional_intelligence
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: urses‚Äô job performance. As mentioned below are six hypotheses that the researchers have 
tested:

Abstract 
Stress can affect individual‚Äôs performance which in turn can impact an organization‚Äôs performance. This study 
was conducted in order to gain a better understanding of what types of situations cause stress in health service 
providers and how that stress affects job performance especially services that provided to the patient
