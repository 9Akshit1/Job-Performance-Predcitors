📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
The aim of this PhD thesis is to shed light on the role of non-cognitive skills in the labour market in the past, the present and the future. In paper 1, I synthesise the academic evidence on the Role of Non-Cognitive Skills. In Paper 2, I analyse the impact of skills and abilities on the automatability of consuming occupations. InPaper 3, I focus on how a traditional measure ofNon-Cognition skills determines wage outcomes for men and women. The author synthesises the academic evidence on the role of non-cognitive skills. She finds that agreeableness is punished more for men than it is for women. Increasing technological innovation and disruptions to modern labour markets are changing the way we work. Increasing technological innovation and disruptions to modern labour markets are changing the way we work. I study a large data set of job advertisements to analyse which non-cognitive skills are rewarded over time. I find that data science skills are evolving rapidly with the need to upskill on them frequently.

1. PREDICTOR: cognitive ability
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 0.91
   CONTEXT: , I explore whether women with the same level of personality traits (i.e., scoring 
high or low on a respective personality trait) have a different likelihood of making it to the top 
as compared to men. I estimate the probability of being in the top income quintile for men and 
women and compare across high versus low levels of different personality traits. I focus on the 
Big Five factor model a

links of all Big Five personality traits with wages (Nyhus and Pons, 2005; Heineck, 2011; 
Nandi and Nicoletti, 2014; Collischon, 2020). They further highlight that personality 
coefficients change when including gender and/or occupation controls, which motivates 
running subsequent analyses at the occupation lev

3. PREDICTOR: education
   CATEGORY: education
   CONFIDENCE: 0.9
   CONTEXT: regressions in the tables below. They 
highlight how the association of personality traits and wage outcomes changes when including 
different controls and motivate the main analysis that follows. Specifically, Table 2-5 below 
documents results from running a simple regression of wage (i.e. either log hourly wages or 
the main outcome variable top income quintile) on personality (i.e. either the 

4. PREDICTOR: skills
   CATEGORY: skills
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: s and convey them to others with the help of 
social skills. 
 
Specifically, a 10 percentage point increase in the share of ‘collaborative leadership’ together 
with ‘research’ predicts an increase in occupational wages by 0.01% in 2014-2015 increasing 
to an estimate of 1.78% in 2018-2020 Q1. The latter effect has a dollar value of an additional 
0.88$ per hour when evaluated at mean hourly wage

5. PREDICTOR: drive
   CATEGORY: motivation
   CONFIDENCE: 0.6
   CONTEXT: ification (1) is only 
weighted by the number of observations in each state and occupation cell. Specification (2) 
additionally controls for O*Net job zone codes accounting for education and experience 
requirements in an occupation, basic state-level demographic controls from the American 
Community Service and the share of ads in each two-digit North American Industry 
Classification (NAICS) in

   CATEGORY: leadership
   CONFIDENCE: 0.8
   CONTEXT: -zero coefficients that are selected through the Lasso shrinkage process and 
that are most relevant and significant in explaining the logarithm of hourly wage.  
 
In Table 3-4, the ‘collaborative leader’ category significantly predicts variation in occupational 
wage in the two time periods. ‘Collaborative leader’ interacted with ‘research’ has a positive 
wage premium in 2018-2020 Q1. As per Ta

7. PREDICTOR: social skills
   CATEGORY: teamwork
   CONFIDENCE: 0.8
   CONTEXT: Appendix 3.E, the share of this 
interaction also increases over time from 9.5% in 2014-2015 to 13.2% in 2018-2020 Q1. This 
suggests that those skilled in both research and collaborative leadership skills are becoming 
more valuable to employers as the Fourth Industrial Revolution progresses. This is intuitive 
because as automation increases and advanced technologies replace human cognitive abil

   CONTEXT: results. I further choose 
to analyse the top tertile of the Big Five traits for easier interpretability of the interaction and 
because this study focuses on rewards to strong personalities. The regression is:

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
3.3.1. 
Wages and skills groups 
The aim in this study is to relate the share of skills demanded for nine skills groupings at an 
occupation/state level to wage data at the occupation/state level for two time periods 2014-
2015 (shortly before start of the Fourth Industrial Revolution) and 2018-2020 Q1 (onset of the 
Fourth Industrial Revolution). The nine skill groupings are: ‘collaborative leader’, 
‘interpersonal & organised’, ‘big data’, ‘cloud computing’, ‘programming’, ‘machine 
learning’, ‘research’, ‘math’ and ‘analytical’. In a first instance, I run a regression of the 
logarithm of hourly wages on the nine skills groups as follows: 
 
log(AB7&)%& =  5 +  9DE!++D!%& + ;$"*F$+D +  <%&          
 
 
(3.1) 
 
 
where log(AB7&)%& is the inflation-adjusted logarithm of mean hourly wages in occupation o 
in state r. The main independent variable DE!++D!%& is a vector of the share of the nine skills 
groups where i denotes the share of skills group i in occupation o in state r. The s

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
The detailed estimates by abilities and skills can be found in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively 
in Appendix B. Overall, I find that skills and abilities which relate to non-linear abstract 
thinking, which we term ‘brains’, are those that are the safest from automation. An example 
would be the skills of critical thinking and monitoring of performance that involve using 
 
21 
information that is available to pass judgement and make decisions. Another example is fluency 
of ideas that is an idea generation and reasoning ability which relates to the ability to come up 
with a number of ideas about a topic (i.e., the number of ideas is important, not their quality, 
correctness, or creativity), which is highly unlikely to be automated. In this case, ‘brains’ is 
shorthand for thinking and can involve reacting to other individuals (e.g., in caring or teaching 
professions), performing a service (e.g., as mechanic or fine dining waiter) or engaging in agile 
or creative thinking (e.g., in
