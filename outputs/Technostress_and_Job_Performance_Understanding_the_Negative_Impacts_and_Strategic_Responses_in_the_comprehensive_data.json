  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "The study delves into the increasingly pertinent issue of technostress in the workplace. It highlights how technostressed manifests in different forms – from anxiety and frustration due to constant connectivity to the pressure of adapting to new technologies. The paper also explores the dual role of technology as both a facilitator and a hindrance. The study examines the experiences of employees from diverse sectors. It highlights how technostress manifests in different forms – from anxiety and frustration to the pressure of adapting to new technologies. The paper also explores the dual role of technology as both a facilitator and a hindrance in the workplace. Technostress leads to decreased productivity, diminished job satisfaction, and increased turnover intentions. Strategic interventions, such as training programs, and fostering a positive technological culture, can mitigate these negative effects. These interventions not only help in managing technostress but also in harnessing the potential of technology for enhanced job performance.",
