  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "This study characterized the effects of aging on individual cognitive domains and how sex, jobtype, and years of education alter the age effect on older adults from Barbados. Results demonstrated that theeffect of age differed across the cognitive domains. The most consistent finding was that high years ofEducation coupled with employment requ requirment. The study aimed to identify which factors altered the effect of age on cognitive performance. Results demonstrated that the effects of age differed across the cognitive domains. High years of education coupled with employment requiring mostly mental effort was the best combination for maintaining high levels of cognitive performance inlate life. The results demonstrate that adverse age effects on cognitive performance may be minimized or delayed through modifiable lifetime exposures in the people of Barbados. The study found thatiring mostly mental effort was the best combination for maintaining high levels of cognitive performance in late life.",
