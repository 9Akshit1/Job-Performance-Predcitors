📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
This meta-analysis builds upon a previous meta- analysis by Joseph and Newman (2010) by including 65% more studies. We classified EI studies into 3 streams: (1) ability based models that use objective test items; (2) self-report or peer report measures based on the four branch model of EI; and (3) “mixed models’ of emotional competencies. The three streams had corrected correlations ranging from .24 to .3. We classified EI studies into 3 streams: ability based models that use objective test items, self-report or peer report measures based on the four branch model of EI, and mixed models of emotional competencies. The three streams correlated differently with cognitive ability and with neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Emotional intelligence (EI) has received a substantial amount of attention in recent years. All three streams of EI exhibited substantial relative importance in the presence of the FFM and intelligence when predicting job performance. The results support the all validity of emotional intelligence.

🎯 JOB PERFORMANCE PREDICTORS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------------------------
1. PREDICTOR: cognitive ability
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: in size. Although our 
studies for job performance only included working samples, we included student samples as 
well when examining the relationship between EI and personality. Consequently, we also 
tested whether student samples differed from working samples for this relationship. The 
results in the final column of Table 3 show that with one exception (out of 18 comparisons), 
emotional intel

   CATEGORY: personality
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: ss, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and cognitive ability, and negatively related to 
neuroticism. Thus, these data support Hypothesis 2. The small to moderate size of the 
correlations indicate that EI is related to these variables, as would be expected on theoretical 
grounds. Stream 3 has a corrected correlation of -0.54 with neuroticism, and 0.49 with 
extroversion; all of the other correcte

   CONFIDENCE: 0.6
   CONTEXT: care, social work, childcare) and social control (e.g., policemen, bill 
collectors). Moreover, Humphrey et al. (2008) argued that leaders also perform emotional 
labor. Thus, the value of emotional intelligence in these other job categories still needs to be 
studied. Along this line of thinking, researchers may also want to focus on how leaders can 
use their emotional intelligence skills to inf

4. PREDICTOR: skills
   CATEGORY: skills
   CONFIDENCE: 0.9
   CONTEXT: es are more closely related to cognitive intelligence, and this 
supports the conceptualization of these measures as a type of intelligence test. The stream 1 
measures also have the lowest correlations with the Big Five personality factors, again 
consistent with how these measures are conceptualized. The stream 1 measures significantly 
differ from the stream 3 measures for cognitive intelligenc

We next created decision rules about which articles to include in the analysis. The

stipulations on date of publication, nationality of sample, or language. However, we

Management literatures.  
Limitations and Future Directions 
One limitation of this study, along with all meta-analyses, is that the numb

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
Sample 
A number of search techniques were employed in order to maximize the likelihood of 
identifying empirical research related to emotional intelligence and performance. We began 
by entering a variety of terms related to EI into electronic databases (e.g., ABI Inform, 
PsycInfo, and Google Scholar). We used emotional intelligence and various combinations of 
the following search terms: neuroticism, emotional stability, extraversion, openness, 
agreeableness, conscientiousness, general mental ability, cognitive ability, intelligence, job 
17 
 
performance, sales, and supervisor rating. The combination of EI with these search terms 
identified over 900 citations. Additionally, a manual search of the most relevant journals 
(e.g., Journal of Organizational Behavior, Journal of Applied Psychology, Leadership 
Quarterly, Academy of Management Journal, Journal of Management, and Personality and 
Individual Differences) helped to identify articles that did not appear in the electronic 


RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
Overall Results of the EI-Job Performance Relation 
Table 2 provides the results of the meta-analysis between EI and job performance as 
well as the relations between each EI stream and job performance. These data supported 
Hypothesis 1a indicating that the overall relation between EI and job performance is positive 
and significant (rc = .28, p < .001). The percentage of variance attributable to sampling error 
20 
 
is 47%, a notable increase over the 27% which Van Rooy and Viswesvaran (2004) reported. 
However, this percentage still falls short of the traditional Hunter and Schmidt (2004) criteria 
of 75% which indicates the presence of potential moderators. However, in addition to the 
Hunter and Schmidt 75% rule, we also examined the credibility intervals and found that they 
did not include zero, which indicates that the effect may not be moderated (Geyskens, 
Krishnan, Steenkamp, & Cunha, 2009). We decided to use the more conservative Hunter and 
Schmidt criterion and, thus, pr

DISCUSSION SECTION EXCERPT:
We found that all three streams of EI correlated with job performance. Streams 2 and 3 
incrementally predicted job performance over and above cognitive intelligence and the FFM. 
In addition, dominance analyses showed that when predicting job performance, all 3 streams 
of EI exhibited substantial relative importance in the presence of the FFM and intelligence. 
These findings offer insight into a number of important issues in the field. This work is the 
most comprehensive, and focused, EI met
