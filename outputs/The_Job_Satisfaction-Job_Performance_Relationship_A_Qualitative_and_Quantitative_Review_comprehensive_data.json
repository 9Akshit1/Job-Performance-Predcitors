  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "The seven general models of the job satisfaction-job performance relationship are inconsistent. Part of the confusion may be due to the piecemeal nature of the research. If there is little relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, little to be gained by testing the validity of Models 1-4. If there is little relationship between job satisfaction and job performance, then there can be no direct causal effect. Models 5-7 could be valid in the context of a zero or very weak correlation between individual satisfaction and performance. An important first step in determining the merits of models of the satisfaction-performance relationship is to determine the magnitude of the relationship. There have been two meta-analyses of the job satisfaction-job performance relationship. Petty et al. (1984) provided a limited meta-analysis of the relationship. The authors confined their analyses to 16 studies that werepublished in five journals from 1964 to 1983.",
