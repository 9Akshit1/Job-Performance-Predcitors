üî¨ STUDY CHARACTERISTICS
--------------------------------------------------
STUDY TYPE: meta_analysis
JOB DOMAIN: healthcare
MEASUREMENT TYPE: self_report
SAMPLE SIZE (N): n=11
SAMPLE CONTEXT: First, samples should come from organizations
because the current study focuses on work motivation and job
performance.

üìã PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
Using the Trim-and-Fill method, the correlation between performance T1 and performance T2 only decreased by 0.02, suggesting the publication bias is not serious. Overall, work motivation appears to be a Predictor of job performance, whereas job performance appearsto be a predictor of work motivation. Table 2 depicts the averaged correlation (r) and true score (œÅ) of interest. Overall, work motivation appears to be a predictor of job performance. However, the path coefÔ¨Åcient (i.e., P1 ‚ÜíM2) from performance (T1) to motivation (T2) is positive. The overall publication bias is not serious. The path coefÔ¨Åcient (i.e., P1 ‚ÜíM2) from performance (T1) to. grotesque (P2) is positive. However, the correlation between P1 and P2 is not as strong as previously thought.

This article provides the Ô¨Årst meta-analysis that estimates the
longitudinal effects between work motivation and job perfor-

contributing to motivation and performance literature. In relation

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
Literature search. To locate the studies that might include the
cross-lagged data about work motivation and job performance,
following early meta-analyses (Neuber et al., 2021; Riketta, 2008;
Van Iddekinge et al., 2018), the authors searched the following
keywords: (a) motivation (motivation or engagement), (b) per-
formance (performance, job performance, task performance, or
organization citizenship behavior), and (c) cross-lagged (long-
itudinal or cross-lagged) utilizing Web of Science and Google
Scholar databases. The authors (W and L) seek to include studies
published from 2000 to 2022. The search was conducted in
January
2023
and
encompassed
English-language
research
materials. We did not restrict the types of research sources,
including journal articles, book chapters, and dissertations.
Authors W and L performed the search using the Title, Abstract,
and Keywords. After removing duplicates, the authors initially
obtained 120 potential articles that used longitudinal data.

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
As Table 1 shows, the results suggest there is not a signiÔ¨Åcant
publication bias. First, using the Trim-and-Fill method, only one
asymmetric effect size was located (i.e., the correlation between
performance T1 and performance T2). After inputting this
‚Äúmissed‚Äù correlation, the averaged correlation only decreased by
0.02, suggesting the publication bias is not serious. Second, uti-
lizing the Eggs‚Äô Regression method, all the p-values are bigger
than 0.05, conÔ¨Årming the publication bias is not signiÔ¨Åcant.
Together, the overall publication bias is not serious.
Table 2 depicts the averaged correlation (r) and true score
correlation (œÅ) of interest. For instance, the œÅ between motivation
(T1) and motivation (T2) is 0.80, whereas the œÅ between per-
formance (T1) and performance (T2) is 0.54.
As Table 3 presents, overall, work motivation appears to be a
predictor of job performance, whereas job performance appears
to be a predictor of work motivation. In particular, the path
coefÔ¨Åcient (i.e.

Findings. To start, we will discuss the magnitude of correlations.
Cohen (2013) suggested that a correlation at 0.1 is small, at 0.3 is
medium, whereas at 0.5 is large. Applying this standard, we Ô¨Ånd
that the magnitudes of correlations of interest are from medium
to large. For instance, the œÅ between motivation (T1) an
