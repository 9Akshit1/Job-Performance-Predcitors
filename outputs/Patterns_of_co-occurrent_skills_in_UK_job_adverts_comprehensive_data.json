  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "A job usually involves the application of several complementary or synergistic skills. Such relationships are implicitly recognised by employers in the skills they demand. Here we construct a skills network based on their co-occurrencein a national level data set of 65 million job postings from the UK spanning 2016 to 2022.  skill clusters display diverse levels of demand and occupy varying roles within the skills network. Clear geographic variation is evident in demand for each skill cluster across the UK. London appears as an outlier as an international hub for finance, education and business. Comparison of data from 2016 and 2022 reveals employers are demanding a broaderrange of skills over time.

The original data set contained 197 million job adverts published by 606,450 different\norganisations and collected via weekly snapshots during 2016 (April-December, 9 months) and 2018,\n17\n2020 and 2022 (complete years), for a total of 45 months. Each job advert contains the free text\nof the original job description, and structured information scraped from the text, e.g., the date the\nadvert was made available, and the name and location of the organisation posting the advert, among\nothers. For this work, we extract from each job advert its unique identifier, date of first posting, and\nlocation associated with the advert, as well as two field",

Crucially, 99.6% of adverts contain at least\none skill. For a full description of the data set and preprocessing, see Methods.\nThe total mentions of skills in the data set is 634 million, i.e., each advert is linked to 9.4 skills\non average.
