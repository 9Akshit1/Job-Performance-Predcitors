  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "In order to examine the utilized measures (i.e., VIA-IS120, CFT20-R, MRS-25, WRPS, WDS), minima, maxima, means, standarddeviations, and reliability coeﬃcients (Cronbach’s alpha) were computed for all scales. Correlations between the metrics and employees’ sex and age were calculated. Skewness and kurtosis of all the measures indicated normal distribution for all variables except the counterproductive work behavior (WDS) The variables representing counterproductivework behavior were substantially L-shaped; therefore, they were used in subsequent analyses. The variables representing counterproductive work behavior were substantially L-shaped. The VIA-IS120 scales, CFT 20-R, and MRS-25 scales were used in the study. The variables representing productive and counterproductive behaviors were transformed for further analyses.",
