üìã PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
In order to examine the utilized measures (i.e., VIA-IS120, CFT20-R, MRS-25, WRPS, WDS), minima, maxima, means, standarddeviations, and reliability coeÔ¨Écients (Cronbach‚Äôs alpha) were computed for all scales. Correlations between the metrics and employees‚Äô sex and age were calculated. Skewness and kurtosis of all the measures indicated normal distribution for all variables except the counterproductive work behavior (WDS) The variables representing counterproductivework behavior were substantially L-shaped; therefore, they were used in subsequent analyses. The variables representing counterproductive work behavior were substantially L-shaped. The VIA-IS120 scales, CFT 20-R, and MRS-25 scales were used in the study. The variables representing productive and counterproductive behaviors were transformed for further analyses.

üéØ JOB PERFORMANCE PREDICTORS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------------------------
1. PREDICTOR: GMA
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: f job performance beyond
the Big Five. The logic and analysis procedure were congruent
1The R package ‚Äúpersonality factors‚Äù only allows for hierarchical regression
analyses with two steps. We therefore regressed all variables with sex and age and
saved the residuals to compute scores for all scales controlling for sex and age.

variance (Olkin‚ÄìPratt adjusted 1R2) of the dependent variables
from Step 1 to Step 2 were of particular interest. If there was a
signiÔ¨Åcant increase in the explained variance, character strengths
exhibited incremental validity beyond GMA (and the control

informed about this in advance.
The sample of employees consisted of N = 169 German-
speaking participants (male: n = 94; female: n = 75) from various
occupational groups. The participants‚Äô mean age was M = 38.36
years (SD = 9.01, ranging from 22 to 61 years). They were highly
educated, as n = 71 ind

   CATEGORY: education

   CONTEXT: e Ô¨Ånal data set included N = 169 cases.
Furthermore, there was substantial dropout on the CFT 20-R
data, because employees needed to change to a diÔ¨Äerent online
platform after Ô¨Ålling out the self-assessment measures in order
to complete the CFT 20-R (i.e., from the Unipark to the Hogrefe
Test System). As some employees did not do so, CFT 20-R scores
were available for 106 of the 169 cases. However

Data Screening
In order to ensure their trustworthiness and accuracy, the
data were screened thoroughly. The raw data encompass 175
employees with complete data on the self-rating measures (i.e.,
VIA-IS120, MRS-25) and supervisor-rated measures (i.e., WRPS,
WDS). A total of 6 cases were excluded from the data analyses:

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
Preliminary Analyses
In order to examine the utilized measures (i.e., VIA-IS120, CFT
20-R, MRS-25, WRPS, WDS), minima, maxima, means, standard
deviations, and reliability coeÔ¨Écients (Cronbach‚Äôs alpha) were
computed for all scales. Furthermore, correlations between the
variables and employees‚Äô sex and age were calculated (see Table 2
for employees‚Äô self-assessments and Table 3 for supervisors‚Äô
ratings of their employees).
Tables 2, 3 show that all measures demonstrated satisfactory
variability with the exception of counterproductive work
behavior (WDS). The minima and maxima indicated that the
sample consisted of participants having low to high scores on
the variables. The scale reliability coeÔ¨Écients were satisfactory
for research purposes. As there were small- to medium-
sized systematic correlations between the utilized measures
and employees‚Äô sex and age, these demographic variables were
included as control variables in the subsequent data analyses in
order to prevent any bias in th

DISCUSSION SECTION EXCERPT:
In the present study, we aimed at investigating the incremental
validity of character strengths as predictors of job performance
beyond GMA and the Big Five. Furthermore, we aimed at
identifying the most important predictors of job performance
out of the 24 character strengths, GMA, and the Big Five.
In order to achieve a Ô¨Åne-grained overview of the interplay
between character strengths and job performance, nine diÔ¨Äerent
subdimensions of productive work behavior and two diÔ¨Äerent
dimensions of co
