  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "The aim of this PhD thesis is to shed light on the role of non-cognitive skills in the labour market in the past, the present and the future. In paper 1, I synthesise the academic evidence on the Role of Non-Cognitive Skills. In Paper 2, I analyse the impact of skills and abilities on the automatability of consuming occupations. InPaper 3, I focus on how a traditional measure ofNon-Cognition skills determines wage outcomes for men and women. The author synthesises the academic evidence on the role of non-cognitive skills. She finds that agreeableness is punished more for men than it is for women. Increasing technological innovation and disruptions to modern labour markets are changing the way we work. Increasing technological innovation and disruptions to modern labour markets are changing the way we work. I study a large data set of job advertisements to analyse which non-cognitive skills are rewarded over time. I find that data science skills are evolving rapidly with the need to upskill on them frequently.",

The nine skill groupings are: ‘collaborative leader’, \n‘interpersonal & organised’, ‘big data’, ‘cloud computing’, ‘programming’, ‘machine \nlearning’, ‘research’, ‘math’ and ‘analytical’. In a first instance, I run a regression of the \nlogarithm of hourly wages on the nine skills groups as follows: \n \nlog(AB7&)%& =  5 +  9DE!++D!%& + ;$\"*F$+D +  <%&          \n \n \n(3.1) \n \n \nwhere log(AB7&)%& is the inflation-adjusted logarithm of mean hourly wages in occupation o \nin state r.

Overall, I find that skills and abilities which relate to non-linear abstract \nthinking, which we term ‘brains’, are those that are the safest from automation. An example \nwould be the skills of critical thinking and monitoring of performance that involve using \n \n21 \ninformation that is available to pass judgement and make decisions.
