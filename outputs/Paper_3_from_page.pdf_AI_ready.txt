üìã PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
Data mining methods have been used to study a variety of topics in industrial and organizational psychology, including predicting employee performance. Out of 103 studies reviewed, eight studies were retained and used for the meta-analyses. The results suggested that both data mining methods showed good performance in employee performance prediction, although the difference between the overall effect sizes was not statistically significant. The number of employee performance classifications meta-analyzed was 2430. The results suggested that both data mining methods showed good performance in employee performance prediction. The difference between the overall effect sizes was not statistically significant. The theoretical and practical implications were discussed, and recommendations were provided for future research. I would first like to thank my advisor, Dr. Shiyang Su, for her continuous support. I am grateful to Dr. Victoria Pace and Dr. Steve Jex for serving as my  committee members. I would like to extend my thanks to Dani Draper, as you always provide unwavering help throughout my time at the program.

1. PREDICTOR: EQ
   CATEGORY: emotional_intelligence
   CONFIDENCE: 0.9
   CONTEXT: studies including theses and dissertations were 
considered. After the application of exclusion/inclusion criteria, one unpublished study was 
included in the analysis. For these reasons, it is expected and recommended that the future 
research would be able to identify more studies in the topic and minimize the effects of 
publication bias to provide more comprehensive conclusions.

practices for presenting the results, creating missing data for the current analysis.  
Secondly, the lack of information provided in the identified primary studies resulted in 
certain adjustments being made for the purposes of confidence interval calculations. More 
specifically, the confusion matrices for multiclass classification models were treated as binary 
classifiers by combining t

3. PREDICTOR: AC
   CATEGORY: assessment_center
   CONFIDENCE: 1.0
   CONTEXT: ing the diverse set of employee samples working at different organizations 
into account, the thresholds for employees‚Äô performances are expected to vary. This implies 
that the heterogeneity is inherent among the studies, as a result of the diverse sample 
characteristics. 
On the contrary, the heterogeneity for the studies using ANN was extremely small, as 
suggested by the I¬≤ = 0. This can be e

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
The results of the quantitative analysis revealed promising outcomes, with respect to 
the performance of DTs and ANNs in employee performance prediction. The pooled DORs, 
sensitivity and specificity values, and the results of the were in congruence with the previous 
studies of data mining methods. More specifically, the results suggested there were no 
statistically significant differences between the overall DORs of DTs and ANNs. 
The heterogeneity statistics for the two data mining methods were in the two extremes, 
necessitating further explanations. As indicated by the I¬≤ value of 85.46, a high variation was 
apparent between the studies using DT methods. One potential explanation of such a high 
heterogeneity might be lying under the fact that different studies used different algorithms of 
DT. More specifically, the DT algorithms that were used included CART (Agaoglu, 2016; 
Mellisa, 2019), C4.5 (Kirimi & Moturi, 2016; Nedelcu et al., 2020; Rajesh, 2017; Wagh, 
2010), and C5.0
