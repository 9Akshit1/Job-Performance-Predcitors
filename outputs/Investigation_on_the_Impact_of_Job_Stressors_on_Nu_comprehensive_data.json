  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "300 questionnaires were distributed to qualified nurses in 7 private hospitals across Malaysia. Outcomes from a series of hypothesis tests support the researchers’ study that each independent variable has significant relationship to job performance of nurses. Authors hope to identify the relationship between the job stressors towards job performance. Stress is a perceived concept that is caused by anything that  unbalances the harmony in one’s life. The relationship can result in either a beneficial or a negative effect on a person. The researchers found that each independent variable has significant relationship to job performance of nurses. Stress is a perceived concept that is caused by anything that unbalances the harmony in one’s life. Different types of stress produce anxiety in individuals, which results in feelings of apprehension that can ultimately lead to negative physical, emotional, cognitive andbehavioral symptoms.",
