üìã PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
A job usually involves the application of several complementary or synergistic skills. Such relationships are implicitly recognised by employers in the skills they demand. Here we construct a skills network based on their co-occurrencein a national level data set of 65 million job postings from the UK spanning 2016 to 2022.  skill clusters display diverse levels of demand and occupy varying roles within the skills network. Clear geographic variation is evident in demand for each skill cluster across the UK. London appears as an outlier as an international hub for finance, education and business. Comparison of data from 2016 and 2022 reveals employers are demanding a broaderrange of skills over time. Comparing data from 2016 and 2022 reveals employers are demanding a broader range of skills over time. Clear geographic variation is evident in the demand for each skill cluster across the UK.

prevalence of individual skills, but also their complementarity and synergy.
The focus on relationships between skills lends itself naturally to network analysis methods, in the
spirit of research in economic complexity, where economic networks are built using empirical data that
captures pairwise relationships between entities (countries, industries, firms) based on similarities of

   CONTEXT: technologies [8, 20, 21]. Given that most jobs, and consequently job adverts,
require several skills [6, 13, 14], the study of modern labour markets must consider not only the
prevalence of individual skills, but also their complementarity and synergy.
The focus on relationships between skills lends itself naturally to network analysis methods, in the

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
The UK job postings data set
The data is provided by Adzuna Intelligence, an online job search engine that collates and organises
information from various sources (e.g., employers‚Äô websites, recruitment software providers, traditional
job boards), and generates a weekly snapshot that captures over 90% of all jobs being advertised in
the UK [17, 30]. The original data set contained 197 million job adverts published by 606,450 different
organisations and collected via weekly snapshots during 2016 (April-December, 9 months) and 2018,
17
2020 and 2022 (complete years), for a total of 45 months. Each job advert contains the free text
of the original job description, and structured information scraped from the text, e.g., the date the
advert was made available, and the name and location of the organisation posting the advert, among
others. For this work, we extract from each job advert its unique identifier, date of first posting, and
location associated with the advert, as well as two field

RESULTS SECTION EXCERPT:
From job adverts to a skills network
Our analysis is carried out on a curated and deduplicated data set containing 65 million job adverts
posted in the UK collected weekly during 2016 (11 million adverts, 1.2 million/month over 9 months),
2018 (18 million, 1.5 million/month, 12 months), 2020 (16 million, 1.3 million/month, 12 months)
2
and 2022 (20 million, 1.6 million/month, 12 months) for an average of 1.4 million adverts per month.
Each advert has its date of first posting, geographical location, and is linked to at least one skill out
of the 3906 skills in the Lightcast Open Skills taxonomy. Crucially, 99.6% of adverts contain at least
one skill. For a full description of the data set and preprocessing, see Methods.
The total mentions of skills in the data set is 634 million, i.e., each advert is linked to 9.4 skills
on average. This means that there is a rich source of information in the co-occurrence of skills within
each advert. As described in Methods, we summarise the patterns

DISCUSSION SECTION EXCERPT:
Using data from 65 million job adverts in the UK between 2016 and 2022, we use a network con-
struction and graph-based multiscale clustering to find data-driven skill clusters based on their co-
occurrence patterns, as demanded by employers.
Our analysis has focused on a configuration of
21 skill clusters (MS21), identified as optimal based on data-driven criteria, as providing enough
granularity and interpretability.
To analyse the relationship between skills in the co-occurrence network, we u
