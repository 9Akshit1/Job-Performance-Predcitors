  "PAPER_SUMMARY": "The original results of Hunter and Hunter (1984) for all 11 of the predictors they compared are presented in Table 1. For the four levels of structure, the sample-size-weighted corre-lations were .ll, .20, .34, and .17 for Level 1 to Level 4 structures. The current Mela-Analysis predicts rho ranging from .20 to .57. Data are from \"Validity and Utility of Alternative Predictors of jobperformance,\" by J. E. Hunter & R. F. Hunter, 1984, Psychological Bul-letin. Dashes indicate that these data were not provided by Hunter & Hunter. The results demonstrate that mean validity generally appears to increase with increasing levels of structure. However, this trend asymptotes at Structure 3, beyond which additional structure yields very little incremental validity (Ar = .01) The results suggest that rhomates of rho along with their population standard deviations, are reported in the lower half of Table 1. The results are from \"Validity and Utility of Alternative Predictors of jobperformance,\" by J. E. Hunter & R. F. Hunter, 1984.",
