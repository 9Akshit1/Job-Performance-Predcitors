🔬 STUDY CHARACTERISTICS
--------------------------------------------------
STUDY TYPE: meta_analysis
JOB DOMAIN: healthcare
MEASUREMENT TYPE: self_report
SAMPLE SIZE (N): N = 897
SAMPLE CONTEXT: The sample collected in Barbados was collected through a multi-stage stratified
cluster sampling approach.. First, using the national election registry, a random sample of
households was selected.. The present study sample included 1325 older adults with no measured cognitive
deterioration and complete data.

📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
This study characterized the effects of aging on individual cognitive domains and how sex, jobtype, and years of education alter the age effect on older adults from Barbados. Results demonstrated that theeffect of age differed across the cognitive domains. The most consistent finding was that high years ofEducation coupled with employment requ requirment. The study aimed to identify which factors altered the effect of age on cognitive performance. Results demonstrated that the effects of age differed across the cognitive domains. High years of education coupled with employment requiring mostly mental effort was the best combination for maintaining high levels of cognitive performance inlate life. The results demonstrate that adverse age effects on cognitive performance may be minimized or delayed through modifiable lifetime exposures in the people of Barbados. The study found thatiring mostly mental effort was the best combination for maintaining high levels of cognitive performance in late life.

🎯 JOB PERFORMANCE PREDICTORS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------------------------
1. PREDICTOR: cognitive performance
   CATEGORY: cognitive_ability
   CONFIDENCE: 0.9
   CONTEXT: physical effort type job. For job type, the estimated odds ratio favored a
decrease of 46.0% (95% CI: 0.324, 0.900) probability of losing one point on the digit span
questions when having a mixed effort job compared to a physical effort type job.

   CONTEXT: r each cognitive domain using the Jamovi
v1.6 software package (Jonathon Love, 2019). A priori tests of the linearity of the continuous
predictor variables, education, and age, were tested using the Box-Tidwell test (Box & Tidwell,
1962). In addition, collinearity statistics were assessed for any collinearity between the predictors
in the models. The continuous variables were mean-centered to remo

using regression analysis to identify the questions that best explain cognitive deterioration (Icaza
& Albala, 1999). The MMSE consists of six domains: orientation assessed with questions about
the time (four points), immediate memory recall of three words (three points), working
memory assessed with a reverse digit span of 

4. PREDICTOR: EQ

   CONFIDENCE: 0.9
   CONTEXT: ge, years of education, job type, and sex. The
mean age was 71.82 years, with a standard deviation of 7.81 years and a range of 60 to 97 years.
The mean years of education were 5.39 years, with a standard deviation of 3.44 years and a range
of 0 to 20. There were multiple modes in the data, with 25 people having zero years of education,
112 having one year, 318 having three years, 529 having five

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
Data
The cross-sectional data for this study are from the Survey on Health, Well-Being and
Ageing (SABE) in Latin America and the Caribbean (Pelaez et al., 2006). The SABE is a
multi-city study conducted in seven Latin American and Caribbean cities, including Bridgetown,
Barbados. The sample collected in Barbados was collected through a multi-stage stratified
cluster sampling approach. First, using the national election registry, a random sample of
households was selected. One individual aged 60 years and older was selected and interviewed
within each household. Of the 1,878 households identified with a person above sixty, there was
an 80% response rate, with 1,508 interviews conducted. The interview assessed cognitive
abilities, sociodemographics, household characteristics, health and functional status, health care
utilization, and anthropometry.
The present study sample included 1325 older adults with no measured cognitive
deterioration and complete data. Complete data means each par

Table 2 shows the results from the six binomial logistic regression models. A brief
description of the overall results is provided here, followed by detailed results for each cognitive
domain. The model predicting paper was the only domain where the model, including the
interaction terms, was significant. The models predicting orientation, digit span, delayed recall,
and circle drawing were significant, including age and lifetime exposure variables. No model
was significant when predicting immediate recall.

DISCUSSION SECTION EXCERPT:
The results of this study demonstrate that age, education, job type, and sex all differ in
21
their impact on cognitive performance. Advancing age consistently negatively affected task
performance, which differed in its magnitude across the cognitive domains. Greater education
demonstrated positive, negative, and no effects. Greater engagement in mental effort during work
demonstrated consistent positive benefits compared to jobs relying more on physical effort. Sex
displayed significant effects
