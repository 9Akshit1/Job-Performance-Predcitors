📋 PAPER SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------
The NEO-Personality Inventory – Revised and Performance Appraisal Questionnaire were used as measuring instruments. The results showed that Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness were related to task performance and creativity. Three personality dimensions explained 28% of the variance inparticipants’ management performance. The NEO-Personality Inventory – Revised is as meet-                instrumente gebruik. Emotional Stability, Openness to Experience and Agreeableness explained 28% of the variance in                participants’ management performance. Drie persoonlikheidsdimensies, naamlik Emosionele Stabiliteit, Ekstroversie and Konsensieusheid, hou.

The five personality dimensions seem to be relevant to different cultures.

The results of this study confirm that the pharmaceutical
company should consider the personality dimensions of 
their employees when predicting creativity and managerial
performance during selection and career development.
However, more research is needed before these results are 
used to predict job performance because they were not
obtained in a selection context. Furthermore, b

METHODS SECTION EXCERPT:
Research design 
A survey design was used to achieve the research objectives. The
specific design was the cross-sectional design, by means of
which a sample is drawn from a population at a particular point
in time (Shaughnessy & Zechmeister, 1997). 
Sample 
The sample includes employees of a corporate pharmacy group
with 14 retail and 16 hospital pharmacies in the North West
Province, Free State, Mpumalanga and Gauteng, as well as a
head office (N = 159). The total population of pharmacists (n =
59) and non-pharmacists (n = 100) was included in the
empirical study. All pharmacists had a B.Pharm. degree or a
Diploma in Pharmacy, while the qualifications of non-
pharmacists varied from Grade 10 to a master’s degree. About
57% of the sample had some form of post-school education.
The total population of employees participated in the research.
Approximately 83% of the sample consisted of females. The
ages of the participants varied between 18 and 58 years, with
53% in the age group between

Table 1 shows that above average scores were obtained on the
three dimensions of the PAQ. Regarding skewness and
kurtosis, it is clear that the results were somewhat skew
regarding Task Performance. This skewness may be attributed
to the fact that poor performers on this dimension probably
left the organisation. Scores on the other dimensions seem to
be normally distributed. Table 1 shows that high Cronbach
alpha coefficients were obtained for all the factors (Nunnally
& Bernstein, 1994). The correlation coefficients between the
items of scales (0,48  r  0,70) indicate that the items
correlate too highly (Clark & Watson, 1995). However, this
should be seen in the context

DISCUSSION SECTION EXCERPT:
Analysis of the product-moment correlations between
personality dimensions, task performance and creativity
showed that no practically significant relationships existed.
However, the results of the canonical analysis showed that a
combination of emotional stability (i.e. low Neuroticism),
Extraversion, Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness
explained about 15% of the variance in task performance 
and creativity. 
It seems that employees who tend towards Neuroticism (i.e. who
are prone to h
